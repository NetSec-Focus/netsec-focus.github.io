### Rapid 7

*Listing Date:* `Dec 6, 2017`

**Contact:** `@Kalabaster on slack`

**Title**: `Potato Engineer`

**Location**: `DC Metro`

**Description**:
```
Work supporting the Rapid7 Managed Detection and Response SOC, a 24/7 SOC with flexible hours with general shift work. Do like data? We like data. We like getting this data and enriching it, correlating it, and transforming it into something that doesn't make security analysts and threat hunters want to cry themselves to sleep.

You will be building infrastructure and code to support your own developed toolsets (or integrate POC'd code developed by analysts) to enable the finding of evil in small to large (20,000+ endpoint) environments. Beers in the office fridge, nerf guns, weekly voluntary training sessions on voted topics, and the chance to chill with some of the smartest misfits in the biz (and also me).

Do you want to Build services and applications to enable efficiencies for service delivery teams?

Do you believe there is a better way to do incident detection and response, vulnerability management, and application security?

Can you work on standing up and maintaining well documented Rest API frameworks that analysts can query with their own duct-taped together scripts.

Can you make JSON great again?

Can you appreciate the need to take in ALL THE DATA (so analysts don't have blind spots), then turn that data into info, and then make sure that only the things that matter keep getting served up and drop the other stuff.

Can you Go, JS, Python, play in the cloud, play with JSON, and play with databases all at once, or want to learn how to?

Can you handle do all of the stack on the front end to make these million data points into not just something pretty, but something with consistent and considerable value to other technically minded individuals?

Can you handle analysts handing off POC (broken, sad, but effective/working) code and saying "plz maek enterprize pretty".

Formal Listing:

Ignore the garbage on the posted ad, these are the things that matter:

Can you speak to how you can catch bad guys?

If someone finds malware on a system, can you do something with it that isn't just "look it up on virustotal and see if it's bad by its score" (i.e. find it out how it got there and what it did using filesystem, memory, network forensics)?

If I gave you a malicious PDF, how could you figure out how to see if it's bad (using google, etc)?

How can you prove evidence of execution on a file system?

What's shimcache and why is it useful?

What are different ways malware can establish persistence?

Can you code in python, go, or angular.js?

If I gave you a 2 GB csv of log data, can you do something useful with the data inside it, other than cry uncontrollably?

If you don't know the answer to these things, would you be able to learn it quickly if I gave you recommended reading on the subject?

Have you read and can you speak to any of these books: "Incident response and Computer Forensics, Third Edition", "Practical Malware Analysis", "The Art of Memory Forensics"?
```

**Salary**: `25-40k (Belfast), 90k-130k (Alexandria) + 10% bonus (can go higher based off performance). Base salary in DC can go deep into 6 figures, but you have to actually know your shit for that.`
