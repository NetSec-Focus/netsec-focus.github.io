First and foremost, NSF is a community meant for Cybersecurity / IT professionals to share knowledge and experiences. To facilitate this effort there are certain chat channels that are meant for professional discussion only. And others that have less moderation in which users are free to speak their minds.


## Channel Guidelines
In the following channels: please refrain from posting memes, inappropriate content, trolling, excess banter, etc.
**Rule of thumb: If it isn't appropriate for the workplace, don't post it.**

* **~Announcements** - Community news
