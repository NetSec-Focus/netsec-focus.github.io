First and foremost, NSF is a community meant for Cybersecurity / IT professionals to share knowledge and experiences. To facilitate this effort, there are certain chat channels that are meant for professional discussion only. And others that have less moderation in which users are free to speak their minds.


## Channel Guidelines
In the following channels: please refrain from posting memes, inappropriate content, trolling, excess banter, etc.
**Rule of thumb: If it isn't appropriate for the workplace, don't post it.**

* **#assembly** - Reverse engineering, malware, shellcoding and exploit development
* **#ctf** - CTFs, Vulnhub, Boot2root, etc
* **#defense** - DFIR and security architecture
* **#dev** - Programming, development, and scripting
* **#education** - Anything relating to certifications, degrees, and training
* **#events** - Plan meetups, talk about events and conferences.
* **#general** - General technology talk (stuff without a dedicated channel)
* **#hardware** - Physical Hardware, servers, switches, laptops, desktops, etc
* **#jobs** - Discussion of career development, and job postings (recruiters allowed)
* **#linux** - Everything \*nix
* **#news** - Bots that spam news articles, tech news only.
* **#pentest** - Offensive security, pentesting, redteam, and social engineering
* **#windows** - Everything Windows

On the other hand, the channels below are considered more casual and unmoderated. People are free to speak as they wish here as long as they do not violate the **General Rules**. We're a big believer in free speech, so please respect everyone's right to express themselves. **Note: These are not default channels.**

* **#entertainment** - Music, movies, tv shows, video games, and more
* **#offtopic** - Anything goes
* **#politics** - The only place for political discussion
* **#sysadmin** - Sysadmin workplace musings
