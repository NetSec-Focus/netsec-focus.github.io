**Delivery:** Hybrid, in-person and online.\\
**Costs:** ~$20k-45k (depending on workstudy and transferrables).

### CompSci Focused
#### Georgia Tech OMS CS

**Reason:** It's accessibility, associated costs, delivery platform, brand name, and high quality of material all conspire to make this one of the most solid choices available.\\
**Delivery:** Online\\
**Costs:** ~$16k

### Efficiency Focused
#### WGU

**Reason:** This university cannot get enough props for the successes they've made in their stated goal: offering a quality degree that caters to the working professional. Unbeatable in the objective metrics of time-to-complete, associated costs, and employability. Regionally accredited, this school often seems as too good to be true, with a price model that allows you unlimited access to any and all classes upon enrollment for 6 month periods, allowing documented cases of individuals achieving their masters degrees in only 6 months time.\\
**Deliver:** Online\\
**Costs:** ~$3k-16k
